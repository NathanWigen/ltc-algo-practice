# Algorithm Practice

## Goals

- Practice at least 1 algorithm per day for 100 (business) days
- Share insights around logic and across languages

### Problem 1

```
Given a two-digit integer, return the sum of its digits.

Input: 29
Output: 11

Input: 30
Output: 3
```

### Problem 2

```
Write a function called oddsEvens that given a string, prints its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as space-separated strings on a single line.

Input: Hacker
Output: Hce akr

```

### Problem 3

```
Write a function called isAnagram that, given 2 strings, returns true if the strings are anagrams
isAnagram("cinema", "iceman") == True
isAnagram("randum" "werdz") == False
```

### Problem 4

```
Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

Input: ["aba", "aa", "ad", "vcd", "aba"]
Output: ["aba", "vcd", "aba"]
```

### Problem 5

```
Write a function called largestNumber that will return the largest value from an array.

Input: [1,2,5,10]
Output: 10
```

### Problem 6

```
Write a function called printArr that will print the items of an array.

Input: ['sally','monique','caleb']
Output: 

sally
monique
caleb

```

### Problem 7

```
Write a function called isPalindrome that, given a string, returns true
if the string is a palindrome, and false if not

Input: isPalindrome("tacocat")
Output: True

Input: isPalindrome("nottacocat")
Output: False
```

### Problem 8

```
Write a function called likes which takes in an array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples and is dependent on the number of elements in the array.

Input: likes([])
Output: "no one likes this"

Input: likes(["Peter"])
Output: "Peter likes this"

Input: likes(["Jacob", "Alex"])
Output: "Jacob and Alex like this"

Input: likes(["Max", "John", "Mark"])
Output: "Max, John and Mark like this"

Input: likes(["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"])
Output: "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
```

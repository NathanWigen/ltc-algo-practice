### Problem 1

```
Given a two-digit integer, return the sum of its digits.

Input: 29
Output: 11

Input: 30
Output: 3
```

### Problem 2

```
Write a function called oddsEvens that given a string, prints its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as space-separated strings on a single line.

Input: Hacker
Output: Hce akr

```

### Problem 3

```
Write a function called isAnagram that, given 2 strings, returns true if the strings are anagrams
isAnagram("cinema", "iceman") == True
isAnagram("randum" "werdz") == False
```

### Problem 4

```
Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.

Input: ["aba", "aa", "ad", "vcd", "aba"]
Output: ["aba", "vcd", "aba"]
```

### Problem 5

```
Write a function called largestNumber that will return the largest value from an array.

Input: [1,2,5,10]
Output: 10
```

### Problem 6

```
Write a function called printArr that will print the items of an array.

Input: ['sally','monique','caleb']
Output: 

sally
monique
caleb

```
